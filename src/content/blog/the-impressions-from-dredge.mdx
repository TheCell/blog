The first few hours of the game really got me into the game. It has an extremely thick atmosphere, and the fear of the sea gets to you. As soon as it gets dark, you race back to the port because you are afraid of what could happen.

Once you start to understand the games mechanics a bit more, the fearful atmosphere starts to fade.

I still enjoyed the game until the end, but admittedly, I was driven more by finishing up the quests instead of curiosity.

As always, here are the best of screenshots on [imgur](https://imgur.com/a/1d56d74) and you can find the entire set of screenshots on my Steam profile here [Steam Screenshots](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Thecell/screenshots/?appid=1562430&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall)
