title: Deploying Angular in a Subdirectory
---

If you want to deploy your angular app in a subdirectory, you need to change the angular build options a bit.
Lets say, we have www.thecell.eu as domain and we want to run the blog in the subfolder www.thecell.eu/my-blog.
Angular breaks, in different ways because absolute paths to resources and navigation both normally assume, that we run in the root directory.

First we update our prod build script command. We add the **--base-href** param.

```typescript
// package.json
[...]
  "scripts": {
    "ng": "ng",
    "start": "ng serve",
    "build": "ng build",
    "watch": "ng build --watch --configuration development",
    "prod": "ng build --base-href /my-blog/ --configuration production ", // [!code focus]
    "test": "ng test",
    "lint": "ng lint"
  },
[...]
```

Urls in html templates must be relative instead of absolute. This means, they need to start with a leading **.** (punctuation). If you have media directly linked in a html file, they must be fixed like this:
```html
// html template file
<div class="video-container">
    <video width="320" height="240" #videoPlayer (click)="onClick()" (ended)="onEnded()">
        <source src="/ratings/example_video.mp4" type="video/mp4"> // [!code --]
        <source src="./ratings/example_video.mp4" type="video/mp4"> // [!code ++]
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video> 
</div>
```

If we take a look at the output html we can see that the **\<base href="/">** has been replaced with our subdirectory.
This is all we need to make it work. Navigation works now and files can be displayed.
```html
// generated index.html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>VirtualProductionWebsite</title>
  <base href="/"> // [!code --]
  <base href="/my-blog/"> // [!code ++]
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">
</head>
<body>
  <app-root></app-root>
</body>
</html>
```
