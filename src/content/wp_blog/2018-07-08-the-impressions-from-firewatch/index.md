Firewatch is a short game about a Firewatch tower in a forest. You play a man who wants to get away from his life for a summer and is on duty to protect the woods from fires. You regularly have radio contact to another firewatch member and you start to discover the land. Beautiful looking game, short (which is neat) and kept me playing until the end. The story is not deep, don't expect too much there.
