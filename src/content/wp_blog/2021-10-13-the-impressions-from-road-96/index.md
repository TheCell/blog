The first run was over pretty fast for me because I didn't understand what happened when the energy dropped to 0. Because of that, I thought it was going to be hard to get to the border and I had wrong expectations of the game. I'm glad I stuck with the game and gave it another try. It's really not that hard and a lot of the game is more about the characters you meet. You will meet them several times with different hitchhikers and graudally learn more about their objectives. It's not too procedural at all if that's what concerns you.

The game was well put together. The music is definitely the strongest part of the game, I love how many tracks there are and how good some of them are. Saddly, the game had some crashes, mostly when playing till the wall and starting a new run. The characters are pretty fun, but the story is not very deep and the characters don't really evolve too much. It's more of a getting to know them with a gradual guiding of the direction they go.

As always, here are the best of Screenshots on imgur and you can find the entire set of screenshots on my Steam profile here [https://steamcommunity.com/id/Thecell/screenshots/?appid=1466640&sort=oldestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Thecell/screenshots/?appid=1466640&sort=oldestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall).
