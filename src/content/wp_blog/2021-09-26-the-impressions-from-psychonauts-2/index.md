After so many years of waiting, it has finally arrived. Psychonauts 2 is a long-awaited follow-up to one of the most creative games I've played. And in Psychonauts 2, I actually got into the credits as a Fig backer!

The first game was a bit rough to get into at the start, but once I got through the first level, I started to love it. The second title has a much better start to the story and it is easy to get into.

Psychonauts 2 introduces new mechanics slowly, so you spend some time learning and mastering each mechanic, which is great. I loved how late into the game you got new mechanics, and it was always refreshing to learn something new.

Just like the first game, the second title has the "normal" world where all characters reside and then you start diving into very absurd minds and learning what their insides are like. The minds were just as creative and quirky as the minds from the first game. With really top graphics and so much love for details.

As always, here are the best of Screenshots on imgur and you can find the entire set of screenshots on my Steam profile here [https://steamcommunity.com/id/Thecell/screenshots/?appid=607080&sort=oldestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Thecell/screenshots/?appid=607080&sort=oldestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall).
