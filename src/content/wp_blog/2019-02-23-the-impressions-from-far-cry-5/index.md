Let's be real. I haven't played Blood Dragon, Far Cry 4, New Dawn and still not a lot has changed from Far Cry 3. I did not like the story in Far Cry 5 at all. However, the gunplay is satisfying. I like games where one good aimed shot can finish enemies off and this was definitly the only thing that kept me playing Far Cry 5 til finish. The world they build was good and looked really beautiful but felt a little empty while roaming. All in all I enjoyed taking out entire camps silently. When situations get out of control it's awesome to be a terminator with aimed headshots. But thats about all I liked about the game.
