Oh my god, this game. I have wanted to play it for a long time now, but I never took the time to play it and after seeing this awesome fan song, I just had to play it. So I did!

The game does not explain a lot and you dig yourself deeper into this weird place and learn more about what happened. There is some excellent environmental storytelling happening and the game was just created to shine with breathtaking visuals and amazing looking environments. This game was just a never-ending source of amazing looking rooms.

he music was good and the game knows how to set new standards for how to mix movie qualities into a game. The chapter titles get displayed over the screen and look fantastic. Sometimes there are videos playing over the gameplay with semi-transparency, and the characters are very well written.

I bow to Remedy Entertainment.
