For a while, I thought you were lost In the depths where lovers meet One last smile and fingers crossed Is how you left the lovers seat.

I wonder will we be Up to the legend once we heard I wonder if we will see Each other flying as (two) halcyon Birds

Iâ€™ve tried to make them burn and let them all fade away Yet these memories remain, stuck in my bones and my brain
