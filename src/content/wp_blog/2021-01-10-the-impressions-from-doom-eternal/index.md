I finally played Doom Eternal and it was just as fun as Doom 2016. I had some technical problems with audio which I could not fix and so I played the game with soundcutoffs, a shame really. I liked the combat very much. The game forces you to swap your guns all the time and you won't stand still at all. There is a nice mix of close up and distance fighting and presents a good variety of weapons.
