The game is a mix of sidescroller jump'n'run and soulslike games. For every new territory you go to you have to learn the layout until you find the cartographer who sells you a map of the region. You get money from killing enemies and when you die you lose everything until you fight your way back to your ghost and kill the ghost. If you fail to do so and die a second time all your money is lost. I liked the challanges of the game but not so much the backtracking. There is a "metro" but still you have to travel a lot of the region to get to a place and ultimately that is what prevented me from finishing the game. At one point I could not be bothered to continue because I spent 12 hours playing and felt it is not worth spending another 12 to finish the game.
