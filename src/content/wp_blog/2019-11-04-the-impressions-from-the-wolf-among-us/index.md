It's a fun story but I felt the backstory to the main character hindered me at identifying with the character. I had mostly one option to respond how I felt but the game tried to push his old character quite a bit. All in all it was a nice story in an interesting world. Not as emotionally loaded as I expected it to be after the walking dead though.
