I played through Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice this weekend and I it is quite a beautiful game. My Steam Review for it:

> This game was pure eyebleach. I loved the visuals so much. The music that is carefully sprinkled in is perfect and the story is unique and really worth every minute. I can't thank Ninja Theorie and the involved people enough for this game that's nothing short of a masterpiece.
> 
> Make sure to watch "Hellbladde function" in the main menu after finishing the game. It gives valuable insight into the intentions and making of the game, really topped the game off with great insights.
