Path of Exile has a randomly generated map but there are a lot of hints that help you orient yourself and get through maps quicker. This is a list of all the known hints.

**Akt 1** [![](./images/A1_Waypoint_map_act_1.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A1_Waypoint_map_act_1.jpg)

**The Submerged Passage** [![](./images/A1_SubmergedPassage.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A1_SubmergedPassage.jpg) The Doublestairs lead to the ledge. The flooded depths are mostly located near the stairs. The stairs are normally located at the bottom right of the map and the flooded depths are on the left side of the stairs.

**The Ledge** [![](./images/A1_Ledge.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A1_Ledge.jpg) There are 3 little stonepiles at the Waypoint. Those piles show you the direction of Kuduku and the climb.

**Prison** You just follow the bloodtrace to find brutus.

**Prisoner's Gate** [![](./images/A1_PrisonersGate.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A1_PrisonersGate.jpg) You use the street to orient yourself. On one Side there is a Stonewall and on the other side is a cscliff. The cliff shows you where the way is. You don't have to meet piety to close the next entrance first.

**Akt 2** [![](./images/A2_Waypoint_map_act_2.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A2_Waypoint_map_act_2.jpg) **The Riverways** [![](./images/A2_Riverways.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A2_Riverways.jpg) At the waypoint you search for 2 Pillars and an overgrown street. This street leads to the Wetlands. If you follow the street to the left you will get to the western forests.

**The Western Forest** [![](./images/A2_WesternForest.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A2_WesternForest.jpg) You follow the path untill you see the broken up street. The overgrown street leads to Alira. The other side of the Path contains the Weaver's chambers.

[![](./images/A2_WeaversChambers.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A2_WeaversChambers.jpg) Nothing to see here besides a mighty penis.

**The Chamber of Sins Level 1** [![](./images/A2_ChamberOfSins1.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A2_ChamberOfSins1.jpg) The Stairs are located in one of the 2 lower edges of the chambers. The wrong chamber contains a big blue pack of monsters.

[![](./images/A2_ChamberOfSins23.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A2_ChamberOfSins23.jpg) Fidelitas is always on the north side of the waypoint. The Trial is through the south door. On the north side you keep to the right edge and you look for an elongated corridor. It mostly contains an carpet in the middle of the floor.

**The Caverns** [![](./images/A2_Caverns.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A2_Caverns.jpg) As soon as you arrive at the caverns you keep to the left. The entrance to the ancient pyramid is always on the left side. There are doors to the left that lead to a dead end so be mindfull and don't always take the first possible door. As it turns out that's not always the case.

**The Ancient Pyramid** [![](./images/A2_AncientPyramid.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A2_AncientPyramid.jpg)

[![](./images/A2_AncientPyramid4.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A2_AncientPyramid4.jpg)

[![](./images/A2_AncientPyramid3.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A2_AncientPyramid3.jpg)

[![](./images/A2_AncientPyramid2.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A2_AncientPyramid2.jpg) The Pyramid has always a diagonal layout. To orient yourself you check the bottom corner and that gives you a hint in which corner you stand. Just walk diagonal into the opposite direction.

**Akt 3** [![](./images/A3_Waypoint_map_act_3.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A3_Waypoint_map_act_3.jpg) **The Warehouse District** [![](./images/A3_WarehouseDistrict2.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A3_WarehouseDistrict2.jpg)

[![](./images/A3_LunarisTemple0.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A3_LunarisTemple0.jpg) In the lunaris temple you look at the carpet. This is not a dead giveaway but generally gives the right direction. In the big room the carpet always leads to the next corridor.

**The Lunaris Temple Level 2** [![](./images/A3_LunarisTemple3.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A3_LunarisTemple3.jpg) To get to Piety you always have to climb the stairs. But the stairs are not always in a straight line.

**The Lunaris Temple Level 2** [![](./images/A3_LunarisTemple2.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A3_LunarisTemple2.jpg) The lasts stairs have carts on each side. The side with only one wagon lead the path. The other side leads to a dead end.

**The Imperial Gardens** [![](./images/A3_ImperialGardens.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A3_ImperialGardens.jpg) At the waypoint you can go into 3 directions. Straight off the path is the hedge maze. The left path leads to the library. To the right side is the scepter of god.

**The Sceptre of God** [![](./images/A3_SceptreOfGod.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A3_SceptreOfGod.jpg) There is no save orientation here. But the stairs are always in one of the 4 corners.

**Akt 4** [![](./images/A4_Waypoint_map_act_4.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/A4_Waypoint_map_act_4.jpg) There are no known hints in act4.

**The Lord's Labyrinth** [![](./images/LabExits.jpg)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LabExits.jpg) You always have to travell through the area. Once you reached an exit, the other exits are mostly on the same height to the left or right.
