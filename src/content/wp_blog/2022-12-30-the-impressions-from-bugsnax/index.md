This game was quite the surprise. It's all about catching bugsnax and eating them but whenever the citizens eat them, they turn bodyparts into bugsnax. It's a weird mix of a light-hearted bughunt and a mystery to solve which might turn a bit dark towards the end.

The main gameplay is basically finding out how to catch each bugsnack. I've done all sidequests but the interesting part is finding out about the island and what bugsnacks really are. There is an extra island and more that I think might be missable.

As always, here are the best of screenshots on imgur and you can find the entire set of screenshots on my Steam profile here [https://steamcommunity.com/id/Thecell/screenshots/?appid=674140&sort=oldestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Thecell/screenshots/?appid=674140&sort=oldestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall).
