I loved this game. Keep it in mind that DOOM doesn't serve you the awesome moments on a silver tablett. By that I mean that it is not like Wolfenstein where the story is super interwoven into the game and cutscenes everywhere. It's old school cool where you have to step out and appreciate what just happened. The game is fast paced and has tight controlls, it pushes your adrenalin and the music pumps you up. I feel like a bad ass running through the tunnels chasing demons down. It almost feels like the demons are scared of you when you are in the middle of a rampage.

While we are on it, check out the GDC talk about the music. I really love that talk and watched it multiple times.
