This game has set out to be beautiful and it certainly is. I love how it starts out looking somewhat like moebius drawing and later gets a very neat water color estetic mixed in. The audio is on point and very supportive, background music even fades when you dive under water. The gameplay altough is basic and stays very basic. It's more of a get through the world and experience it with ocasional challanges. For this type of game it's fine though.
