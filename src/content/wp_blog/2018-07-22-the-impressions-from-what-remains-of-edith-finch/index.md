Oh my god what a piece I missed in 2017. What Remains of Edith Finch is a short and VERY worthy game to spent time with. It oozes creativity in creative story telling and surprised me a few times. It is heavy story driven and such a good editet game. Don't let the start let you off when you have to walk to the house. It really sets the mood and hooks you in. I recommend this very much. Please consider playing.
