[![simonstalenhag](./images/simonstalenhag-1024x561.png)](http://blog.thecell.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/simonstalenhag.png)I found a real nice artist, his paintings have a Sci Fi touch. I really love the drawing style. You can even buy his drawings as Canvas, Framed, mounted, matted, photographic. Just take a look at the Pictrues they are well sized (1080px and more) and I have even changed my background to one of those.
