This game is like pongs ball grew up and got it's own game. You play this little pong and now YOU decide when you change direction instead of beeing externally determined by the two bars. You go small ball, the world is yours.  
At first the change in direction seems counter intuitive when going up and down because on click you only change the direction up and down and never from left to right or right to left. After a short while you'll get it. The game keeps on challenging you with new and interesting puzzle problems and for the entire game the gameplay stays fresh.

Saddly I could not upload all screenshots on for this game on steam. It's an electron app and therefore basically a website where I could not take steam screenshots.
