This game is basically a kaleidoscope turned into a game. You progress from playfield to playfield, and everything is repeated endlessly. Every playfield has a set challenge that you have to solve by turning your perspective and transporting squares with a fixed gravity direction. Each side has an assigned color, and blocks will fall to the ground as long as you are aligned with that gravity. If you change your gravity, the blocks freeze in place.

All in all, the game was fun to play. The puzzles are challenging until you get the hang of them. There are more concepts introduced during the game, giving you a greater variety of challenges. However, I felt that the challenges lacked a bit of depth compared to the amazing kaleidoscope-like graphics. If you play the game for the mind-bending graphics and you enjoy puzzling a bit, you are in luck :)

As always, here are the best of screenshots on imgur and you can find the entire set of screenshots on my Steam profile here [https://steamcommunity.com/id/Thecell/screenshots/?appid=473950&sort=oldestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Thecell/screenshots/?appid=473950&sort=oldestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall).
