Dark Souls 3 is the third in the Souls series which I enjoyed very much. They upped the graphics to impressive levels compared to DS1 and 2. I still like Dark Souls 1 the most but thats because of the leveldesign. Dark Souls 3 has the best fighting mechanic and dynamic of all the Souls games and it was the most fun to play and fight. The world is very fleshed out and looks fantastic, enemies blend into this environment and everything is very fitting.
