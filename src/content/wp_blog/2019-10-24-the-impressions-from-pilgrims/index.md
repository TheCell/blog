As all Amanita games have a unique and identifiable style to them, I instantly recognized Pilgrims. The game is a small point'n'click style game that can be played through in an hour more or less. It puts emphasize on replayability in the form of achievements which to achieve make the puzzles harder to solve. The games "puzzles" are the refreshing change in the point'n'click genre. You actually find more people which you then can use to interact with other people, each reacting uniquely and having different abilities and personalities.
