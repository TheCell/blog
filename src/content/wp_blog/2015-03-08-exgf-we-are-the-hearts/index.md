Imaging we are higher than the sparrows Casually we're breathings with the feathers Tragically we fall just like the arrows You will hear our voices echo

WE, WE ARE THE HEARTS We'll never part of the soul WE ARE THE HEARTS Forever singing oh, oh, oh, oh WE ARE THE HEARTS And the future won't spill our bones WE ARE THE HEARTS Forever singing oh, oh, oho
