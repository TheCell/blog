Just went through my screenshots of the game again. I still think I could not handle another playthrough at the moment. This game is all about an intense story and should be played with total commitment. If you love good movies that makes you cry you are in for one hella rollercoaster here. I'd say this game was the most emotionally attaching game I've played so far.
