This game was fun while it lastet. Every chapter has a unique day and night color and the entire game hyper stylized. The goal of the game is to set up cameras and record squirrels on their nightly walks to find their nut stashes. There is no time pressure and you are free to wander around in closed of areas of the park. It has some Firewatch vibes to it.
