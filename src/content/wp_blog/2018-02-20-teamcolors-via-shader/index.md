In my mentorat I ventured into shader progamming. For that I decided to get into teamcolors and how to color units via shader instead of having identical models with different textures. This allows to have one model and one texture with practically no limitations on the number of teams. The texture is partially semitransparent and at those points I mix the teamcolor in. The final product can be viewed here: [Teamcolor website](http://dev.thecell.eu/teamcolorshader/). More explanation and the presentation as pdf can be found here: [Presentation](http://docs.thecell.eu/ShaderprogrammTeamcolors.pdf) [Shader Paper](http://docs.thecell.eu/shaderFarben.pdf) [Github](https://github.com/TheCell/stuga1x)
