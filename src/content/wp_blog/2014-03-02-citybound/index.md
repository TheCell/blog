Just found out about an indie game. Since I love SimCity etc. and I like programming, this could be a piece of great interest. Its programmed in Javascript using WebGL for 3D graphics. That means: it's playable in every modern browser and is not bound to a Platform!

Thats not all, since it's programmed in Javascript you will be able to mod it and rewrite parts of the game. Endless fun incoming!
