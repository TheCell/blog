Another short game from Amanita Design. I wondered how long they would use the unique graphics without doing a dark / horror game. It suits the style so well. It was a fun ride, and I liked the length. It was not too long for the mechanics, and visually it was very varied.

As always, here are the best of Screenshots on imgur and you can find the entire set of screenshots on my Steam profile here [https://steamcommunity.com/id/Thecell/screenshots/?appid=1206060&sort=oldestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Thecell/screenshots/?appid=1206060&sort=oldestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall).
