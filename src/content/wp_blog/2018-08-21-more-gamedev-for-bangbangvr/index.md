Previously on BangBangVR:Â [https://blog.thecell.eu/blog/2018/07/29/some-gamedev-progress-on-a-little-project/](https://blog.thecell.eu/blog/2018/07/29/some-gamedev-progress-on-a-little-project/) And here is an update on the sideproject. Lets look at the previous Todo list:

- Working Canon
- impact size
- Ground Texture Shader (Blending)
- Ground Texture Shader (display impact)
- Figuring Multiplayer?

Terrain Shader at the moment. (edge is not ok and textures are not good at some faces)

And that's about it for things I've done when I've given an outlook on it. But wait, there's more.

Inputs for the console

I created 2 Input elements for the command console. A launch button still missing and adaptation for the steam vr controllers. But this should be less work than before.

I felt like the loop shoot a cannon, adjust, shoot again is a bit too short. Therefore I took my balista controll script from Battosai VR and reimplemented it in this game to controll a flak cannon. The goal is to have something defensive to try and shoot enemy bombs down before they hit the player. In the meantime I implemented a clay pigeon thrower and clay pigeons (clay discs really). Here are some impressions from that:

Before gathering infos for this post I felt like I haven't progressed much but seeing the progress since last post encouraged me quite a bit. Bad thing first: University (well school for applied science really) will start again in 13 days and I have to bring the htc vive back soon after. I still have a lot left to do, the list changed and grew a bit:

- working cannon
- Ground Texture Shader (display impact)
- optimize impact deform performance
- optimize impact size
- ground texture blend for big hills
- Figuring Multiplayer?
