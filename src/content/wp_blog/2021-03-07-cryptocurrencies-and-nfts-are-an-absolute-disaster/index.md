This blog post is for me to collect resources when I stumble upon examples of the problem of NFTs.

Very good blog post that sums up lots of unsolvable problems with NFT: [https://everestpipkin.medium.com/but-the-environmental-issues-with-cryptoart-1128ef72e6a3](https://everestpipkin.medium.com/but-the-environmental-issues-with-cryptoart-1128ef72e6a3)

This twitterpost by [@isoyourguy](https://twitter.com/isyourguy) is a short thread with a couple of examples.  
"artists pay to list pieces, buyers pay to place or cancel bids, artists pay to accept bids. this is all paid in speculative funny money that you need to buy in advance."
