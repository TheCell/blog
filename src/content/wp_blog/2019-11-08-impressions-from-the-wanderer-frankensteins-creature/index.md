The colors and the watercolor look really makes the game unique. The style goes so well with the soundtrack. The style and music carries the story forward and helps to cope with the sad nature of the game. The emotions are well transported without the need for extensive dialogs, which I was positively surprised by. I can recommend the Wanderer as a beautiful experience.
